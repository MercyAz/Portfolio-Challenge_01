# Portfolio-Challenge_01
This challenge is to create a webpage which would tell you basic information about me.
* The work presents a page which displays my name, my recent photo as well as a background image, working links to sections about me, my recently completed project work, and how to contact me.
* The header contains navigation links to various sections of the page and when called, they navigate to the corresponding section
* The portfolio section of my page shows images (avatar) which is a screenshot of my deployed project as well as a link to the project.
* I have styled the image to the application to have a box-shadow feature and transform which allows it to become larger than the corresponding imgaes on hover.
* The image of any deployed project takes the user to the deployed applications while the READ MORE tag takes the user to the Github repository of the application. 
* The page is also responsive on various screen size.

# Find Below the screenshot of the webpage.
